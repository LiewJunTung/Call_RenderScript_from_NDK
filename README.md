# Call_RenderScript_from_NDK
An android studio sample of hellocomputendk with gradle + cmake+ ndk

The original sample code is in: 
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/rs/+/ee6f190/java/tests/HelloComputeNDK

I added cmake support instead of android.mk and I added renderscript support by gradle.
